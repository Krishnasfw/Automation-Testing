# Automation-Testing

Welcome to automation testing with Selenium. In this Blog, we're going to learn about Selenium topics.

Automation testing signifies the technique of performing testing with the use of tools. In this case, a tool will conduct the testing in place of a person. The only item being used to replace the person is a test automation tool.

# Selenium

Selenium is a test automation tool, i.e., using developed code, the Selenium tool will automatically carry out testing instead of a human doing it by hand.

# Selenium Features

-> A open-source and handy web testing framework is Selenium.
-> Selenium can only automate Web Applications 
-> Without having to learn a test scripting language, Selenium IDE offers a playback and record feature for creating tests.
-> It is regarded as the top cloud-based testing platform because it enables testers to log their actions and export them as reusable scripts with an intuitive user interface.
-> Operating systems: Mac, Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS.
-> Browsers: Apple's Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge, among others.
-> Additionally, it supports parallel test execution, which shortens test times and improves test effectiveness.
-> Selenium is compatible with a wide range of browsers, operating systems, and programming languages. 
      The list is as follows:
           C#
          Java
          Python
          PHP
          Ruby
          Perl
          JavaScript are examples of programming languages.
-> For source code compilation, Selenium can be integrated with frameworks like Ant and Maven.
-> For application testing and producing reports, Selenium can also be integrated with testing frameworks like TestNG.
-> Comparatively speaking, Selenium uses fewer resources than other automation test tools.
-> One of the most significant changes to Selenium has been the inclusion of the WebDriver API.
