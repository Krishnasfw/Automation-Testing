# Automation-Testing

Welcome to automation testing with Selenium. In this Blog, we're going to learn about Selenium topics.

Automation testing signifies the technique of performing testing with the use of tools. In this case, a tool will conduct the testing in place of a person. The only item being used to replace the person is a test automation tool.

# Selenium

Selenium is a test automation tool, i.e., using developed code, the Selenium tool will automatically carry out testing instead of a human doing it by hand.

# Selenium Features

-> A open-source and handy web testing framework is Selenium.
-> Selenium can only automate Web Applications 
-> Without having to learn a test scripting language, Selenium IDE offers a playback and record feature for creating tests.
-> It is regarded as the top cloud-based testing platform because it enables testers to log their actions and export them as reusable scripts with an intuitive user interface.
-> Operating systems: Mac, Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS.
-> Browsers: Apple's Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge, among others.
-> Additionally, it supports parallel test execution, which shortens test times and improves test effectiveness.
-> Selenium is compatible with a wide range of browsers, operating systems, and programming languages. 
      The list is as follows:
           C#
          Java
          Python
          PHP
          Ruby
          Perl
          JavaScript
-> For source code compilation, Selenium can be integrated with frameworks like Ant and Maven.
-> For application testing and producing reports, Selenium can also be integrated with testing frameworks like TestNG.
-> Comparatively speaking, Selenium uses fewer resources than other automation test tools.
-> One of the most significant changes to Selenium has been the inclusion of the WebDriver API.

# Selenium Components
      Selenium is known as the selenium suite since it is a collection of many testing tools. Each has a unique testing environment.

# Pre-requisites for Selenium
 In order to understand Selenium in a better way, we need to know the below pre-requisites first:
      Basic software testing
      HTML 
      CSS
      Locators
      Java
      
# Installation of testing platform for Selenium

**Step 1:** Download and install the Java platform - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
**Step 2:** Download and install Eclipse IDE  - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
**Step 3:** Click File -> New -> Project for the workspace. or Alt+Shift+N

**Step 4:** Need to select a wizard from the window. Note: For a Simple Project we can use to click the Java Project. If we need to use any Framework for our project we can go with the Maven Project. In this we can go with the Java Project and Click Next button.

**Step 5:** After clicking the Next button, The New Project window display on the Screen. We need to provide the Project name and click the Finish button.

**OUR PROJECT WORKSPACE AND CODING AREA IS READY!!!**

If you get notice in to the Project structure, there is Library displayed and it flows from our JDK nothing but our JAVA platform and src (Source Folder).

**To create a new Package**

Right click on the src and select the Package option for creating new package. Form the package, need to create one class.

Without creating a package, we able to create a class, at that time the package name takes as  a **default package**. But **src -> Package -> Class** is the right way for creating the project for Selenium. 


# Locators
      Locators are help to find the UI elements on the webpage for Selenium. 

**Types of Locators**
      By using locators, the webdriver interacts with ID, Name, Class, Partial link, XPath, CSS selectors and Link text.

**XPath in Selenium**

**Types of XPath** 
      1. Absolute Xpath
            * Absolute XPath starts from root node and ends with desired elements
            * It starts from single slash. Like full XPath
      2. Relative XPath
            * Relative XPath statrs from any node in between of the web element
            * It starts with double slash. Mostly we prefer this type of the XPath.
